**Zenith Flight Simulator**
A FOSS, physics based flight sim in Godot.

**Flying**
See left MFD for PFD with flight data. 
All units are SI units for now. 
Rotate at 20 m/s, land at 20 m/s with flaps down. Do not exceed 35 m/s.

**Controls**
See right MFD for controls.

**Credits:**
Basis of the project, rewritten with custom physics:

Very helpful function for local forces:
